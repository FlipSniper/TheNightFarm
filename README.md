This is a godot game and the 2nd one I've ever made.
This is my first Readme I've ever made apart from one I edited... 
Anyways a quick summary of the game: Fight enemies at night. They drop items, sell items and buy mutated seeds to grow using the enemies mutated liquids.

There's only 2 weapons right now: A broken mace and a sword Get them through the shop and grow them through their seed.
Enemies can drop water and mutated water orbs and a very rare radioactive vial... this vial may crash the game
Anyways this game is under development and will be my siege project for all 13 weeks hopefully?

Update:
I added a spell - Fireball.
And currently working on a boss, with smart movement + special attacks.
