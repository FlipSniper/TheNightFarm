This is a godot game and the 2nd one I've ever made.
This is my first Readme I've ever made apart from one I edited...
Anyways a quick summary of the game:
Fight enemies at night. They drop items, sell items and buy mutated seeds to grow using the enemies mutated liquids.

There's only 2 weapons right now:
A broken mace
and a sword
Get them through the shop and grow them through their seed.
